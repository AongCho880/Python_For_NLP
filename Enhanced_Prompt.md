# Core prompt (concise & effective) **(RoadMap)**

Create a comprehensive, logically ordered learning roadmap of **Python topics to learn before working in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
**Audience:** motivated beginner with basic programming familiarity.
**Goal:** be ready to build and ship small NLP projects (e.g., text classification, NER, simple RAG).
**Output format:** a table with columns: *Topic*, *Why it matters for NLP*, *Key sub-skills/APIs*, *Mini exercise*, *Estimated study time*.
**Scope constraints:** focus on Python-specific skills and essential libraries; exclude deep ML theory except what’s needed to use models.
**Depth:** brief bullets per row; 10–20 rows total.
**Ordering:** foundational → intermediate → applied.
**Extras:** mark 5 “must-learn first” topics with ⭐.

## Optional add-ons you can include

* **Tooling preference:** “Use examples for Python 3.11+, pip/uv, and Poetry/virtualenv workflows.”
* **Library focus:** “Prioritize `re`, `itertools`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `dataclasses`, `unittest/pytest`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `spaCy`, `Hugging Face transformers/datasets`, `tokenizers`, `pydantic`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`.”
* **Project tie-ins:** “After the table, propose 3 capstone mini-projects (in one paragraph each) that rely only on the listed topics.”
* **Timebox:** “Target ~60–90 hours total; show a rough hours column.”
* **Prereq check:** “Start with a 5-item checklist to verify readiness.”
* **Environment:** “Assume Linux/macOS; include commands for setting up a virtual environment.”

## Variants (pick one if you prefer)

* **Beginner-friendly version**
  Generate a friendly, step-by-step checklist of Python skills needed for NLP. Use plain language, short bullets, and include a 2–3 sentence explanation per section plus a tiny practice task. Keep it under 400 words.

* **Interview-prep version**
  List Python/NLP-adjacent topics commonly probed in interviews. For each, provide: one-liner definition, a quick code snippet, gotcha/pitfall, and a sample interview question.

* **Production-focused version**
  Produce an outline of Python topics for deploying NLP in production: packaging, config management, logging, testing, data validation, async I/O, vector DB clients, batching, streaming, and performance profiling. Include links-to-concepts (no external URLs needed), and sample CLI/HTTP patterns.
