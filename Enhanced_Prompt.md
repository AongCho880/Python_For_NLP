# 02. Core prompt (focused & actionable) **(String)**

Create a **step-by-step tutorial on Python strings for NLP**, using **real NLP-style examples** (tweets, chats, product reviews, multilingual snippets).
**Audience:** beginner–intermediate Python user headed toward NLP.
**Goal:** be able to clean, normalize, and pattern-extract text robustly, using only Python’s standard library (plus `re`, `unicodedata`).
**Python:** 3.11+.
**Style:** numbered steps; short explanations; runnable code blocks; tiny exercises with expected outputs.

**For each step, include these subsections:**

* *Concept* → what it is in Python strings
* *Why it matters for NLP*
* *Code example (NLP-flavored)*
* *Mini exercise* + *expected output*
* *Common pitfalls* (1–3 bullets)
* *Quick quiz* (1–2 MCQ)

**Steps to cover (in order):**

1. `str` vs `bytes`, UTF-8 basics; reading/writing text safely
2. Immutability, slicing, indexing, `in`, `len`, `ord/chr`
3. Whitespace & line handling: `strip/split/splitlines`, irregular spacing
4. Case handling for NLP: `lower()` vs `casefold()`
5. Unicode normalization: `unicodedata.normalize`, accents, look-alikes
6. Punctuation, quotes, emojis: identify & filter (`string.punctuation`, `unicodedata.category`)
7. Token-ish splits with strings: `split`, `partition`, `rsplit`, `splitlines` (and when this is NOT enough)
8. Regex for NLP: `re` basics, flags, word boundaries, groups; URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis
9. Search/replace/translate: `replace`, `translate/maketrans` for mapping (e.g., smart quotes → ASCII)
10. Pattern extraction: capturing key phrases, n-grams via simple loops, counting with `collections.Counter`
11. Normalization pipeline: composing the above into `clean_text(text) -> str`
12. Performance & safety: `''.join(...)` over string concatenation, `io.StringIO`, `timeit`, big-O gotchas
13. Lightweight evaluation: before/after samples, quick checks, and reversible transforms

**NLP-type example requirements (sprinkle across steps):**

* Clean a tweet: remove URLs/handles, keep hashtags, compress repeated chars (“soooo”→“soo”? explain choice)
* Normalize multilingual text (e.g., “naïve/naive/naïve” and Bengali/Arabic digits)
* Extract intents like “return/refund” phrases from reviews
* Count top hashtags/mentions and surface emojis by sentiment hint
* Build a reusable `clean_text()` with toggles (keep_hashtags=True, keep_emojis=False, etc.)

**Deliverables at the end:**

* A single consolidated code block with the final `clean_text()` function and example usage
* 10 short practice prompts with expected outputs
* A 10-item checklist to self-verify mastery

**Constraints:**

* Prefer standard library; do not introduce external NLP libraries.
* Keep each step under ~120 words + code.
* Show inputs and outputs for every example.

---

## Optional add-ons

* **Dataset stub:** Provide 8–10 tiny sample texts (tweets/chats/reviews; include emojis & non-Latin).
* **Regex playground:** After each regex step, add 2 variants to harden the pattern (e.g., stricter URL vs quick URL).
* **Multilingual focus:** Include examples from English + one RTL language + one Indic script.

---

## Steps to cover (in order)

1. **Sequences overview:** list vs tuple vs `array` (when bytes/ints matter)
2. **Lists:** token lists, slicing, in-place ops; when `append/extend` vs `+`
3. **Tuples:** immutable records; using tuples as dict keys (e.g., bigrams)
4. **`dict`:** vocab maps, term→id, label→count; dict views and membership
5. **`defaultdict` & `Counter`:** frequency tables, n-gram counts, class distributions
6. **Sets & frozensets:** dedup vocab, stopword lookup, membership speed
7. **`OrderedDict` & insertion order (Py≥3.7):** keeping stable vocab indices
8. **Stacks/Queues/Deques (`collections.deque`):** sliding windows for n-grams, streaming chat logs
9. **Heaps (`heapq`):** top-K frequent tokens/hashtags without sorting everything
10. **`bisect`:** quick sentiment bucketing / length bins / time bins
11. **`itertools`:** efficient n-gram generation, chunking, pairing; lazy pipelines
12. **`namedtuple` / `dataclasses`:** tidy sample objects (text, label, meta) with type hints
13. **`typing` basics:** `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `Iterable[str]` for clearer APIs
14. **Tries (dict-of-dicts) & simple prefix matches:** intent lexicons, emoji alias maps
15. **Sparse-ish structures:** dict-of-`Counter` for co-occurrence matrices
16. **Performance patterns:** `''.join`, prealloc, avoiding quadratic ops, `timeit`
17. **Persistence:** `json` for vocab/label maps; when to use `pickle` carefully
18. **Putting it together:** mini pipeline using the above (vocab, n-grams, top-K, co-occurrence)

---

## NLP-type example requirements (sprinkle across steps)

* Build a **vocab with frequencies** from tweets; keep top-K with `heapq`.
* Generate **bigrams/trigrams** of tokens using `itertools`.
* Use **set** for O(1) stopword filtering and profanity list checks.
* Map **(intent, slot)** pairs to counts using `defaultdict(Counter)`.
* Maintain **stable label order** with dict insertion order and show why it matters.
* Use **deque** for a **sliding window** sentiment score over a chat stream.
* Bucket reviews by **length bins** using `bisect`.
* Create a **`dataclass Sample`**: `text, tokens, label, lang`.
* Implement a tiny **trie** for matching product categories (“return”, “refund”, “replace”).
* Build a **co-occurrence matrix** (token→`Counter`) and extract PMI-like signals.

---

## Deliverables at the end

1. **Consolidated utility code block** implementing:

   * `tokenize_basic(text) -> list[str]` (simple, no heavy NLP libs)
   * `ngram(tokens, n) -> list[tuple[str,...]]` (via `itertools`)
   * `build_vocab(texts, min_freq=2, top_k=20000) -> dict[str,int]` (uses `Counter`+`heapq`)
   * `cooccur(tokens, window=2) -> dict[str, Counter]`
   * `top_k(counter: Counter, k:int) -> list[tuple[str,int]]`
   * `Trie` (insert, has_prefix, match_longest) using dict-of-dicts
   * `Sample` as a `@dataclass` with helpful `__repr__`
2. **10 short practice tasks** with expected outputs (e.g., “Given tweets X, Y, Z, show top-3 hashtags with counts”).
3. **10-item mastery checklist** (e.g., “I can explain when to prefer set over list for membership checks”).

**Constraints:**

* Prefer **standard library** (`collections`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `bisect`, `dataclasses`, `typing`, `json`).
* Every example shows **input → output**.
* Keep each step under **~120 words + code**.
* No external NLP libraries.

---

## Starter outline (the tutorial should flesh these with code)

* **Lists vs tuples:** tokens as lists; bigrams as tuple keys in a dict.
* **Counter:** `Counter(tokens).most_common(5)` on review corpus; compare with manual dict.
* **defaultdict(Counter):** label→word counts; update while iterating samples.
* **Set:** `if tok in STOPWORDS:` fast filter; show `len(set(tokens))` for vocab size.
* **Deque sliding window:** maintain last `n` tokens to compute rolling positivity.
* **Heap top-K:** maintain top hashtags on a million-tweet stream.
* **Bisect bins:** place messages into `[0–20], [21–50], ...` token bins.
* **Trie:** longest-prefix match for refund intents; compare to naive scan.
* **Co-occurrence:** build dict-of-Counter; query neighbors of “refund”.

---

## Optional add-ons

* **Streaming mode:** read lines from a file/socket and update `Counter`, `deque`, and heap online.
* **Multilingual focus:** include examples with Bengali/Arabic digits and emoji-heavy chats.
* **Complexity notes:** show big-O for each structure and a quick `timeit` micro-benchmark.
* **Testing:** tiny `pytest` snippets for utilities (golden outputs).

---

## Variant (cheat-sheet)

Create a **one-page cheat sheet** with two columns (*Task* | *Snippet*) mapping common NLP tasks to the ideal Python data structure (e.g., “fast membership check → set”, “stable label order → dict (3.7+)”, “top-K on stream → heapq”).

# Core prompt (focused & actionable) **(File handling & I/O)**

Create a **step-by-step tutorial on Python File Handling & I/O for NLP**, using **real NLP-style data** (tweets, chats, product reviews, multilingual text, logs).
**Audience:** beginner–intermediate Python user headed toward NLP.
**Goal:** reliably read, write, stream, validate, and batch text data at small-to-medium scale using the Python standard library (plus `pathlib`, `csv`, `json`, `gzip`, `io`, `pickle`—used carefully).
**Python:** 3.11+.
**Style:** numbered steps; short explanations; runnable code with input→output; tiny exercises with expected answers.

**For each step, include subsections:**

* *Concept* → what/why for NLP datasets
* *Code example (NLP-flavored)* with input → output
* *Mini exercise* + *expected answer*
* *Common pitfalls* (1–3 bullets)
* *Quick quiz* (1 MCQ)

---

## Steps to cover (in order)

1. **Paths & basic I/O with `pathlib`**: creating data dirs, safe joins, globbing `*.txt`
2. **Text encodings**: UTF-8 defaults, `errors='replace'`, BOM handling, reading mixed-encoding corpora
3. **Reading line-oriented corpora**: iterate large files lazily; `for line in f` vs `read()`
4. **Writing text safely**: newline normalization, `with` context, atomic-ish writes via temp files/rename
5. **CSV/TSV for annotations**: `csv` module dialects, quoting, delimiter issues, header validation
6. **JSON & JSONL**: records vs arrays, `json.dumps/loads`, `jsonlines` pattern with one record per line
7. **Compressed data**: `gzip.open`, streaming `.gz` tweets/logs, when to compress outputs
8. **Binary vs text**: `bytes` vs `str`, when you must open in `'rb'/'wb'` (pickled models, embeddings)
9. **Chunking & batching**: read in N-line batches, yield batches for tokenization or inference
10. **Streaming pipelines**: `io.StringIO` for in-memory text; producer→consumer generators
11. **File validation & schema checks**: required columns, row counts, empties, non-UTF chars
12. **Metadata sidecars**: saving stats (`json`) alongside data; dataset cards (size, lang, label set)
13. **Logging progress**: `logging` basics, counters, ETA for long reads
14. **Simple parallel reads**: `concurrent.futures` with care; order, backpressure, CPU vs I/O bound
15. **Safety & permissions**: exist/not-exist checks, `try/except`, partial file recovery
16. **Persistence choices**: when to use `pickle` (and when not), reproducibility risks
17. **Putting it together**: a tiny CLI: *ingest → validate → clean → write (csv/jsonl/gz)*

---

## NLP-style example requirements (sprinkle across steps)

* Load **tweets.jsonl.gz**, normalize text, and write **clean.jsonl**.
* Read **reviews.tsv**, validate required columns (`text,label,rating`), and report bad rows.
* Stream a **chat log** file, chunk into 512-token-ish batches for later inference.
* Merge multiple **dataset parts** (`part-000*.jsonl`) safely with `pathlib.glob`.
* Create a **dataset card** (`metadata.json`) with counts, languages, and label distribution.

---

## Deliverables at the end

1. **Consolidated utility code block** implementing:

   * `iter_lines(path, encoding='utf-8') -> Iterator[str]` (lazy)
   * `read_jsonl(path) -> Iterator[dict]` and `write_jsonl(path, records)`
   * `read_csv_tsv(path, delim=',') -> Iterator[dict]` with header validation
   * `open_maybe_gzip(path, mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')`
   * `batch_iter(iterable, size:int) -> Iterator[list]`
   * `validate_rows(rows, required_fields: set[str]) -> dict[str,int]` (stats & errors)
   * `safe_write(path, text)` (temp file + rename)
   * `dataset_card(stats: dict, out_path)`
2. **10 short practice tasks** with expected outputs (e.g., “Count lines in `tweets.jsonl.gz` with non-UTF characters and write their indices”).
3. **10-item mastery checklist** (e.g., “I can explain JSONL vs CSV tradeoffs for NLP corpora”).
4. **Tiny CLI demo** (`python ingest.py --in data/*.jsonl.gz --out clean.jsonl`) showing argparse + functions above.

---

## Constraints

* Prefer **standard library**: `pathlib`, `io`, `csv`, `json`, `gzip`, `logging`, `argparse`, `concurrent.futures`, `typing`.
* Every example shows **input → output**.
* Keep each step under **~120 words + code**.
* No heavy external NLP libraries; keep focus on I/O robustness.

---

## Starter outline (the tutorial should flesh these with code)

* **Pathlib glob** to gather shards, sort, and stream.
* **UTF-8 read** with `errors='ignore'` vs `'replace'` (and why to log occurrences).
* **CSV pitfalls**: commas in text, newlines inside quotes, missing headers.
* **JSONL**: append-friendly, random access by line numbers.
* **Gzip**: reading and writing `.jsonl.gz` interchangeably with `open_maybe_gzip`.
* **Batching**: `batch_iter` feeding a `clean_text()` stub; write outputs incrementally.
* **Validation**: fail fast on missing columns; collect bad row examples for debugging.
* **Safety**: `safe_write` to avoid truncated files on crash.
* **CLI**: `argparse` + logging levels (`--quiet/--verbose`).

---

## Optional add-ons

* **Multilingual focus**: detect and replace unusual whitespace, normalize newline conventions across platforms.
* **Checksuming**: write/read a `.sha256` file and verify before processing.
* **Parallelism knobs**: max workers vs file handles; show speedup limits for I/O bound work.
* **Small benchmarking**: `timeit` different read patterns; compare `readlines()` vs iterator.
* **Unit tests**: tiny `pytest` for `open_maybe_gzip`, `read_jsonl`, and `validate_rows`.

---

## Variant (cheat sheet)

Produce a **one-page cheat sheet** with two columns (*Task* | *Snippet*): reading `.jsonl.gz`, validating CSV headers, merging shards with `glob`, writing atomic files, chunking/batching, logging progress, and building a dataset card.
